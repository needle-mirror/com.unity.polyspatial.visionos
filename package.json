    "changelog": "### Added\n- PlayToDevice will now limit the editor framerate to 45 by default in order to lower network congestion. The editor sending too many packets over PlayToDevice could cause significant lag and latency for some users. This limit can be changed in the PlayToDevice window.\n- Fix issue of two scenes simultaneously existing for a frame when new scene is loaded.\n\n### Changed\n- XRTouchSpaceInteractor renamed to XRSpatialPointerInteractor.\n- Update minimum Editor version to 6000.0.22f1.\n\n### Deprecated\n\n### Removed\n\n### Fixed\n- Bones are now parented to the parent of the RootBone instead of to the SkinnedMeshRenderer entity. This fixes an issue where if the SkinnedMeshRenderer was on a different hierarchy than the RootBone, the bones might not be affected by any transforms applied to the RootBone.\n- Child colliders of XRBaseInteractables are now recognized when using XRTouchSpaceInteractor/XRSpatialPointerInteractor.\n\n### Security"
