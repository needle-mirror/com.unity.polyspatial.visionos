Refer to the **PolySpatial Hybrid apps on visionOS** section of the PolySpatial VisionOS documentation for more information.\n- Added the ability to create multiple volume cameras. Refer to the **Volume cameras** section of the PolySpatial VisionOS documentation for more information. \n\n### Changed\n- Updated instructions for setting up 2.x prerelease packages. This currently requires manually pointing your project's manifest.json at the appropriate package versions.\n- Several VisionOS prefixed components (such as VisionOSVideoComponent and VisionOSImageBasedLight) have had DisallowMultipleComponent applied to them, and cannot be added multiple times to the same GameObject."
