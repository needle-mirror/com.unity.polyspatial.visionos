    "changelog": "### Changed\n- We have narrowed down the conditions under which the package will compile from UNITY_VISIONOS || UNITY_IOS || UNITY_EDITOR_OSX to (UNITY_VISIONOS || UNITY_IOS) && UNITY_EDITOR_OSX.  This should eliminate compile errors in the case where you had the OSX editor but not the visionOS or iOS platform dependencies.\n\n### Fixed\n- Wrap all MonoPInvokeCallback methods in try/catch to avoid potential crashes in player builds.\n- Parent SkinnedMeshRenderer bones to parent of the RootBone (so that it's a sibling with the RootBone) rather than to the SkinnedMeshRenderer itself - this fixes an issue where the RootBone was on a different hierarchy than the SkinnedMeshRenderer, and changes applied to the RootBone GameObject didn't affect the bones."
